<h1>TERMS OF USE</h1>
<br>
<h3>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h3>
<br>

<p>Other than as specifically provided in any separate formal purchase agreement between you and MUSICAA, these terms and conditions (this "Agreement") apply to all of your online purchases from the website at www.musicaa.com (the "Site") and may NOT be altered, supplemented, or amended by you through the use of any other document(s). Any attempt to alter, supplement, or amend this document or to enter an order for product(s) which is subject to additional or altered terms and conditions will be null and void, unless otherwise agreed to in a written agreement signed by both you and MUSICAA.</p>
<br>
<h3>ACCEPTANCE</h3>
<br>
<p>By purchasing products and/or services from the Site, you agree to be bound by and accept this Agreement. Orders are not binding upon MUSICAA until accepted by MUSICAA. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. MUSICAA will indicate its acceptance of an order by acknowledging your order by reply email or by shipping the ordered items to you.</p>
<br>
<h3>PRICING</h3>
<br>
<p>Because prices, product descriptions, and availability can change quickly, MUSICAA does not warrant the accuracy or completeness of the information provided on the Site. For more on our pricing policies, please refer to our Site Terms of Use.
MRP is the manufacturer's suggested retail price. We may commonly sell products at prices lower than MRP and, for any given product, no sales may have occurred at MRP.
MRP is a benchmark to compare our discounts from MRP to pricing offered by other retailers. Whether other retailers sell at MRP will vary by product, geographic location, type of store, and over time.

Although we periodically update the MRP in our direct mail offerings and on our website as we receive them, in some cases manufacturers may change their  MRP without notice to us.

Please contact the manufacturer of a specific product for the most up-to-date MRP information.

MRP quoted for house or private label brands are developed internally in consideration of comparable name brand products. We may commonly sell such products at prices lower than MRP and for any given product, no sales may have occurred at MRP.

Although our limited time events are intended to be limited time events, our low prices offered during these events may continue in effect after the event.

Values associated with items labeled "free with purchase" are based upon MRP.</p>
