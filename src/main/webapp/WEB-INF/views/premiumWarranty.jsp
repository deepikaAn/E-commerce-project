<h2>MUSICAA PREMIUM WARRANTY</h2>

<p>To ensure peace of mind and provide a more secure and consistent product experience compared to the various standard warranty plans, Bajaao provides its own premium warranty plan for select products. If available for a product, customers have the option to select "Premium Warranty" options (either 1 or 2 years) on the relevant product page during purchase. Products will come with a MUSICAA "Premium Warranty Card" which is your certificate of purchase that includes the product covered, the duration of coverage (one or two years), Musicaa’s Premium Warranty contact phone information, and your warranty contract’s terms and conditions.
<br>
<h3>How it works:</h3>
<br>
<p>MUSICAA becomes your one and only point of contact for servicing this product
Customers simply call a dedicated support number found in the Premium Warranty Card, and are routed to a Premium Support Service line.
Musicaa Premium Support will then try to troubleshoot over the phone, and if unable to resolve, will have your product shipped to Musicaa’s warranty repair and service center. This ( level 1) servicing is done by competent in-house servicing personnel.
Musicaa will cover shipping expenses both ways. Bajaao will send a courier to pick up/drop off the product from and to your home at Musicaa’s expense. Customers are however, required to keep original packaging, to prevent damage in transit.
If Musicaa service engineers cannot fix the issue in-house, they will directly work with the relevant manufacturer’s service centers to fix the issue. This process can take upto 30 working days. During the entire process, however, Customers deal only with Musicaa.
If Musicaa is unable to repair the product, it will replace the product with a same or equivalent model available.
Parts, Labor charges incurred to fix the product, and shipping of product to/from customer to Musicaa service center are borne by Musicaa. Customers bear no additional expense apart from their initial Premium Warranty purchase.</p>
